Lab 2: Calculations
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 1:
Why is it necessary to add the import math line for the program to work? 

ANSWER: It is necessary because Python needs to be told to load the math module. 
Any functions with math (ex. math.sqrt) are part of the math module which is 
only loaded if the import math function is used.



QUESTION 2:
What result do you get with the new values? 

ANSWER: The result I received from inputting the new values is 12.31990259701756.



QUESTION 3:
Why did these points work initially but cause an error after you made
these changes? 

ANSWER: The points (2.5, 16.3) and (3.2, 28.6) caused an error because I defined 
all of the inputted points as integers, but these points are all floats. 
The program worked at first because I did not label the points as floats or 
integers, I just put them directly into the program. For this to work, I have 
label the points I input as floats instead of integers.
