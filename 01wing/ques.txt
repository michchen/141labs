QUESTION 1:
What value was displayed for each command? What do you think the
** command does? 

ANSWER:
3*2 -> 6
6/2.0 -> 3.0
2 ** 8 -> 256
The ** command is the power command. It treats the second value as a exponent \
to the first, so 2 was taken to the 8th power.



QUESTION 2:
What type do you think "7.0" is? 

ANSWER: "7.0" is a string because of the quotes placed around it. If it were \
7.0 without quotes, then it would be a float.



QUESTION 3:
What was printed by each of the commands? Why were there different
results for each command (i.e. indicate why each result was produced)? 

ANSWER: "7" + "7" -> '77'
7 + 7 -> 14

The results were different because in the first one, they are both strings, so \
the + sign told the shell to add the two together to form one string. That \
explains why '77' appeared. On the second, the two values are integers, so \
the addition sign was treated as a math function and the two integers were \
added together.



QUESTION 4:
What was displayed by the the print statement? What would have been
printed if we changed the print statement to print(First)? 

ANSWER: print(first) -> You
If we changed the print statement to print(First) the output would have been \
Me because the variable First contains the string Me.



QUESTION 5:
Modify the program so that it calculates the sales tax on an item that
costs 1000 dollars. Assume a tax rate of 10 percent or 0.10. 

ANSWER: The total sales tax on the item was 100 dollars.
